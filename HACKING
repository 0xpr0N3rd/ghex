HOW TO BUILD FROM GIT

	First install the build dependencies (i.e. libraries that ghex uses).
	If you're on Debian or Ubuntu you can install the build dependencies
	of the distro packaged version of ghex using the command:

		sudo apt-get build-dep ghex

	If you're on Fedora, the equivalent command is:

		sudo yum-builddep ghex

	Other distributions have similar commands for their package managers.
	Of course, there is no guarantee that the build dependencies of the
	distro packaged version is the same as the git version, but in practice
	the former gets you quite far and if not, autogen.sh will tell you
	what is missing during the next step.

	To configure and build the git version of ghex, run:

		git clone git://git.gnome.org/ghex
		cd ghex
		./autogen.sh --prefix=~/ghex
		make
		make install


	After you have done this you can run and test the built ghex binary using:

		GSETTINGS_SCHEMA_DIR=~/ghex/share/glib-2.0/schemas src/ghex
